        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?
         <br> 
        </p>
        <p>Response: I hope to develope the ability to confidently solve coding problems! I was begining to learn python over the break and am actively trying to build the resillience to work through coding conundrums. I'd also like to build up a library of web design inspiration focused on intuitive navigation and content accessibility!</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter? </p>
        <p>Response:I plan on making a Wes Anderson fan-page showcasing four of my favorite movies by him. I will make each page distinctive with imagery and content specific to each movie, as well as employing the unique color schemes of each movie, which is part of Anderson's signature style. I'll be working in Futura Bold for the landing page as well as The Darjeeling Unlimited and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, whereas I will use Helvetica and Archer for Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Grand Budapest hotel. The header type for each page will be in his classic yellow bold type.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        <p>Response: To be honest I like to imagine Wes Anderson using his fan-page and flipping through some of my favorite movies of his! He’s sitting there in his corduroy suit sipping on absinthe (or whatever Wes Anderson drinks) with a Kinks album playing in the background. His socks would have small red beanies on a field of turquoise and he would laugh and laugh and laugh at the heartfelt attempts of a fansite created by a fledgling design student. Ah yes, and he would laugh…</p>

        <p>Prompt: Make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort..</p>
        <p>Response:         
        <li>
          That it's ok for learning to be clumsy. It can be so hard, especially when you're a creative, to stumble when learning something.
        </li>

        <li>
          That the process will become smoother and smoother the more i practice the new thing I'm learning.
        </li>
  
        <li>
          Motivation to finsih homework: personal projects, some down time. Anything to make me want to drive forward through the muck.
        </li>
          
        <li>
          Acknowlege when I'm being resistant to the work and power through it.
        </li>  
          
        <li>
          Make sure I'm making time for self-care! If I'm resistant AND I haven't eaten or exercised then it's probably going to be difficult for me to make anything until I have taken care of my bodily needs.</p>
